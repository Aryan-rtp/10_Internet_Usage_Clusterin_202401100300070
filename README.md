ðŸ“˜ 2. Introduction

In today's digital age, understanding internet usage patterns can help in categorizing users and personalizing experiences. This project focuses on grouping users based on their online activity data such as daily usage time, site categories visited, and number of sessions per day. By using clustering, we can identify different types of users such as light, medium, and heavy users without any prior labels.

ðŸ§ª 3. Methodology

We used the KMeans Clustering algorithm for this unsupervised learning task. The steps followed in this project were:

Data Collection: Collected data from a CSV file containing user internet usage.

Preprocessing: Standardized the features to bring all values to the same scale.

Clustering: Applied KMeans algorithm to group users into 3 clusters.

Visualization: Used a scatter plot to visualize user clusters based on usage behavior.

ðŸ’» 4. Code

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("internet_usage.csv")

# Standardize data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df)

# Apply KMeans clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
df['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_data)

# Plot the clusters
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(df['daily_usage_hours'], df['sessions_per_day'],
            c=df['cluster'], cmap='viridis', s=100)
plt.xlabel('Daily Usage Hours')
plt.ylabel('Sessions Per Day')
plt.title('User Clustering Based on Internet Usage')
plt.grid(True)
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster')
plt.show()

ðŸ“Š 5. Output

The KMeans algorithm successfully grouped the users into three clusters:

Cluster 0 â€“ Light users

Cluster 1 â€“ Medium users

Cluster 2 â€“ Heavy users

Each user now has a cluster label assigned. The output was visualized using a scatter plot based on daily usage hours and sessions per day.
